<a name="index-summary"></a>

<p>Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project
planning with a fast and effective plain-text markup language.  It
also is an authoring system with unique support for literate
programming and reproducible research.
</p>
<p>Org is implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to
keep the content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling
and structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily
created with a built-in table editor.  Plain text URL-like links
connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any
files related to the projects.
</p>
<p>Org develops organizational tasks around notes files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Project planning
and task management make use of metadata which is part of an outline
node.  Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted in
queries and create dynamic <em>agenda views</em> that also integrate the
Emacs calendar and diary.  Org can be used to implement many different
project planning schemes, such as David Allen&rsquo;s GTD system.
</p>
<p>Org files can serve as a single source authoring system with export to
many different formats such as HTML, LaTeX, Open Document, and
Markdown.  New export backends can be derived from existing ones, or
defined from scratch.
</p>
<p>Org files can include source code blocks, which makes Org uniquely
suited for authoring technical documents with code examples. Org
source code blocks are fully functional; they can be evaluated in
place and their results can be captured in the file.  This makes it
possible to create a single file reproducible research compendium.
</p>
<p>Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when needed.
Org is a toolbox.  Many users actually run only a&mdash;very
personal&mdash;fraction of Org&rsquo;s capabilities, and know that there is more
whenever they need it.
</p>
<p>All of this is achieved with strictly plain text files, the most
portable and future-proof file format.  Org runs in Emacs.  Emacs is
one of the most widely ported programs, so that Org mode is available
on every major platform.
</p>
<a name="index-FAQ"></a>
<p>There is a website for Org which provides links to the newest version
of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked questions
(FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.  This page is located at
