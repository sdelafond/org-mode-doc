<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B History and Acknowledgments</h2>



<a name="From-Carsten"></a><a name="From-Carsten-1"></a>
<h3 class="appendixsec">B.1 From Carsten</h3>

<p>Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of
the Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and
projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.
However, having to remember eleven different commands with two or
three keys per command, only to hide and show parts of the outline
tree, that seemed entirely unacceptable to me.  Also, when using
outlines to take notes, I constantly wanted to restructure the tree,
organizing it parallel to my thoughts and plans.  <em>Visibility cycling</em>
and <em>structure editing</em> were originally implemented in the package
&lsquo;<samp>outline-magic.el</samp>&rsquo;, but quickly moved to the more general &lsquo;<samp>org.el</samp>&rsquo;.
As this environment became comfortable for project planning, the next
step was adding <em>TODO entries</em>, basic <em>timestamps</em>, and <em>table
support</em>.  These areas highlighted the two main goals that Org still
has today: to be a new, outline-based, plain text mode with innovative
and intuitive editing features, and to incorporate project planning
functionality directly into a notes file.
</p>
<p>Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to the
<a href="mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org">mailing list</a> have provided a constant stream of bug reports, feedback,
new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many thanks to
everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying to keep
here a list of the people who had significant influence in shaping one
or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be complete, if I have
forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.
</p>
<p>Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in order:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Bastien Guerry</dt>
<dd><p>Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org (most of
them integrated into the core by now), including the LaTeX exporter
and the plain list parser.  His support during the early days was
central to the success of this project.  Bastien also invented Worg,
helped establishing the Web presence of Org, and sponsored hosting
costs for the orgmode.org website.  Bastien stepped in as maintainer
of Org between 2011 and 2013, at a time when I desperately needed
a break.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Eric Schulte and Dan Davison</dt>
<dd><p>Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org Babel system, which
turns Org into a multi-language environment for evaluating code and
doing literate programming and reproducible research.  This has
become one of Org&rsquo;s killer features that define what Org is today.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>John Wiegley</dt>
<dd><p>John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches directly to
Org, including the attachment system (&lsquo;<samp>org-attach.el</samp>&rsquo;), integration
with Apple Mail (&lsquo;<samp>org-mac-message.el</samp>&rsquo;), hierarchical dependencies of
TODO items, habit tracking (&lsquo;<samp>org-habits.el</samp>&rsquo;), and encryption
(&lsquo;<samp>org-crypt.el</samp>&rsquo;).  Also, the capture system is really an extended
copy of his great &lsquo;<samp>remember.el</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sebastian Rose</dt>
<dd><p>Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would be the
pitiful work of an ignorant amateur.  Sebastian has pushed this part
of Org onto a much higher level.  He also wrote &lsquo;<samp>org-info.js</samp>&rsquo;,
a JavaScript program for displaying webpages derived from Org using
an Info-like or a folding interface with single-key navigation.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>See below for the full list of contributions! Again, please let me
know what I am missing here!

<h3 class="appendixsec">B.2 From Bastien</h3>

<p>I (Bastien) have been maintaining Org between 2011 and 2013.  This
appendix would not be complete without adding a few more
acknowledgments and thanks.
</p>
<p>I am first grateful to Carsten for his trust while handing me over the
maintainership of Org.  His unremitting support is what really helped
me getting more confident over time, with both the community and the
code.
</p>
<p>When I took over maintainership, I knew I would have to make Org more
collaborative than ever, as I would have to rely on people that are
more knowledgeable than I am on many parts of the code.  Here is
a list of the persons I could rely on, they should really be
considered co-maintainers, either of the code or the community:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Eric Schulte</dt>
<dd><p>Eric is maintaining the Babel parts of Org.  His reactivity here
kept me away from worrying about possible bugs here and let me focus
on other parts.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nicolas Goaziou</dt>
<dd><p>Nicolas is maintaining the consistency of the deepest parts of Org.
His work on &lsquo;<samp>org-element.el</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>ox.el</samp>&rsquo; has been outstanding, and
it opened the doors for many new ideas and features.  He rewrote
many of the old exporters to use the new export engine, and helped
with documenting this major change.  More importantly (if that&rsquo;s
possible), he has been more than reliable during all the work done
for Org 8.0, and always very reactive on the mailing list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Achim Gratz</dt>
<dd><p>Achim rewrote the building process of Org, turning some <em>ad hoc</em>
tools into a flexible and conceptually clean process.  He patiently
coped with the many hiccups that such a change can create for users.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nick Dokos</dt>
<dd><p>The Org mode mailing list would not be such a nice place without
Nick, who patiently helped users so many times.  It is impossible to
overestimate such a great help, and the list would not be so active
without him.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>I received support from so many users that it is clearly impossible to
be fair when shortlisting a few of them, but Org&rsquo;s history would not
be complete if the ones above were not mentioned in this manual.
