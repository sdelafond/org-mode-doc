<h4 class="subsection">8.3.2 Repeated tasks</h4>

<a name="index-tasks_002c-repeated"></a>
<a name="index-repeated-tasks"></a>

<p>Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a &lsquo;<samp>DEADLINE</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>SCHEDULED</samp>&rsquo;, or plain timestamps<a name="DOCF68" href="#FOOT68"><sup>68</sup></a>.  In the following example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>the &lsquo;<samp>+1m</samp>&rsquo; is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on &lsquo;<samp>&lt;2005-10-01&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.  You can use yearly, monthly, weekly, daily
and hourly repeat cookies by using the &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>w</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>h</samp>&rsquo;
letters.  If you need both a repeater and a special warning period in
a deadline entry, the repeater should come first and the warning
period last
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d&gt;
</pre></div>


<a name="index-org_002dtodo_002drepeat_002dto_002dstate"></a>
<p>Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
done once you have done so.  When you mark a &lsquo;<samp>DEADLINE</samp>&rsquo; or
a &lsquo;<samp>SCHEDULED</samp>&rsquo; with the TODO keyword &lsquo;<samp>DONE</samp>&rsquo;, it no longer produces
entries in the agenda.  The problem with this is, however, is that
then also the <em>next</em> instance of the repeated entry will not be
active.  Org mode deals with this in the following way: when you try
to mark such an entry as done, using <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd>, it shifts the
base date of the repeating timestamp by the repeater interval, and
immediately sets the entry state back to TODO<a name="DOCF69" href="#FOOT69"><sup>69</sup></a>.  In the example
above, setting the state to &lsquo;<samp>DONE</samp>&rsquo; would actually switch the date like
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue +1m&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>To mark a task with a repeater as DONE, use <kbd>C-- 1 C-c C-t</kbd>,
i.e., <code>org-todo</code> with a numeric prefix argument of &lsquo;<samp>-1</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<a name="index-org_002dlog_002drepeat"></a>
<p>A timestamp<a name="DOCF70" href="#FOOT70"><sup>70</sup></a> is added under the deadline, to keep a record that
you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry is no longer
visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future
instances will be visible.
</p>
<p>With the &lsquo;<samp>+1m</samp>&rsquo; cookie, the date shift is always exactly one month.  So
if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this entry
DONE still keeps it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the task,
this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you forgot
to call your father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call him
3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time
<em>after</em> the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has
special repeaters &lsquo;<samp>++</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>.+</samp>&rsquo;.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">** TODO Call Father
   DEADLINE: &lt;2008-02-10 Sun ++1w&gt;
   Marking this DONE shifts the date by at least one week, but also
   by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into the future.
   However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called and marked it
   done on Saturday.

** TODO Empty kitchen trash
   DEADLINE: &lt;2008-02-08 Fri 20:00 ++1d&gt;
   Marking this DONE shifts the date by at least one day, and also
   by as many days as it takes to get the timestamp into the future.
   Since there is a time in the timestamp, the next deadline in the
   future will be on today's date if you complete the task before
   20:00.

** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
   DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue .+1m&gt;
   Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after today.
</pre></div>

<a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002dscheduled_002dif_002ddeadline_002dis_002dshown"></a>
<p>You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task.  If the repeater is set for the scheduling information only, you
probably want the repeater to be ignored after the deadline.  If so,
set the variable <code>org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown</code> to
<code>repeated-after-deadline</code>.  However, any scheduling information
without a repeater is no longer relevant once the task is done, and
thus, removed upon repeating the task.  If you want both scheduling
and deadline information to repeat after the same interval, set the
same repeater for both timestamps.
</p>
<p>An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies of
a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command
<kbd>C-c C-x c</kbd> was created for this purpose; it is described in
<a href="Structure-Editing.html#Structure-Editing">Structure Editing</a>.

<h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4>

<h3><a name="FOOT68" href="#DOCF68">(68)</a></h3>
<p>Org does not repeat inactive timestamps, however.  See
<a href="Timestamps.html#Timestamps">Timestamps</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT69" href="#DOCF69">(69)</a></h3>
<p>In fact, the target state is taken from, in this sequence, the
&lsquo;<samp>REPEAT_TO_STATE</samp>&rsquo; property, the variable <code>org-todo-repeat-to-state</code> if
it is a string, the previous TODO state if <code>org-todo-repeat-to-state</code>
is <code>t</code>, or the first state of the TODO state sequence.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT70" href="#DOCF70">(70)</a></h3>
<p>You can change this using the option <code>org-log-repeat</code>, or the
&lsquo;<samp>STARTUP</samp>&rsquo; options &lsquo;<samp>logrepeat</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>lognoterepeat</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>nologrepeat</samp>&rsquo;.
With &lsquo;<samp>lognoterepeat</samp>&rsquo;, you will also be prompted for a note.</p>
