<h4 class="subsection">8.4.3 Resolving idle time and continuous clocking</h4>



<a name="Resolving-idle-time-_00281_0029"></a><a name="Resolving-idle-time-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Resolving idle time</h4>

<a name="index-resolve-idle-time"></a>
<a name="index-idle_002c-resolve_002c-dangling"></a>

<p>If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer&mdash;perhaps to take a phone call&mdash;you often need to
&ldquo;resolve&rdquo; the time you were away by either subtracting it from the
current clock, or applying it to another one.
</p>
<a name="index-org_002dclock_002didle_002dtime"></a>
<a name="index-org_002dclock_002dx11idle_002dprogram_002dname"></a>
<p>By customizing the variable <code>org-clock-idle-time</code> to some integer,
such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your
computer after being idle for that many minutes<a name="DOCF81" href="#FOOT81"><sup>81</sup></a>, and ask what
you want to do with the idle time.  There will be a question waiting
for you when you get back, indicating how much idle time has passed
constantly updated with the current amount, as well as a set of
choices to correct the discrepancy:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>k</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-k"></a>
<p>To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press
<kbd>k</kbd>.  Org asks how many of the minutes to keep.  Press
<kbd><span class="key">RET</span></kbd> to keep them all, effectively changing nothing, or
enter a number to keep that many minutes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>K</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-K"></a>
<p>If you use the shift key and press <kbd>K</kbd>, it keeps however
many minutes you request and then immediately clock out of that
task.  If you keep all of the minutes, this is the same as just
clocking out of the current task.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>s</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-s"></a>
<p>To keep none of the minutes, use <kbd>s</kbd> to subtract all the
away time from the clock, and then check back in from the moment
you returned.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>S</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-S"></a>
<p>To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of
the away time, use the shift key and press <kbd>S</kbd>.
Remember that using shift always leave you clocked out, no matter
which option you choose.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-C"></a>
<p>To cancel the clock altogether, use <kbd>C</kbd>.  Note that if
instead of canceling you subtract the away time, and the
resulting clock amount is less than a minute, the clock is still
canceled rather than cluttering up the log with an empty entry.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock, and
now want to apply them to a new clock?  Simply clock in to any task
immediately after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have
subtracted time &ldquo;on the books&rdquo;, so to speak, and will ask if you want
to apply those minutes to the next task you clock in on.
</p>
<p>There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.
Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased
a mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS&rsquo;s power
button!  You suddenly lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save
you still have your recent Org mode changes, including your last clock
in.
</p>
<p>If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that you
have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last
session.  Using that clock&rsquo;s starting time as the beginning of the
unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you want to resolve that
time.  The logic and behavior is identical to dealing with away time
due to idleness; it is just happening due to a recovery event rather
than a set amount of idle time.
</p>
<p>You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for
dangling clocks at any time using <kbd>M-x org-resolve-clocks <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> (or <kbd>C-c C-x C-z</kbd>).
</p>
<a name="Continuous-clocking"></a><a name="Continuous-clocking-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Continuous clocking</h4>

<a name="index-continuous-clocking"></a>

<a name="index-org_002dclock_002dcontinuously-2"></a>
<p>You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked out the
previous task.  To enable this systematically, set
<code>org-clock-continuously</code> to non-<code>nil</code>.  Each time you clock in, Org
retrieves the clock-out time of the last clocked entry for this
session, and start the new clock from there.
</p>
<p>If you only want this from time to time, use three universal prefix
arguments with <code>org-clock-in</code> and two <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd> with
<code>org-clock-in-last</code>.

<h3><a name="FOOT81" href="#DOCF81">(81)</a></h3>
<p>On computers using macOS, idleness is based on actual user
idleness, not just Emacs&rsquo; idle time.  For X11, you can install
a utility program &lsquo;<samp>x11idle.c</samp>&rsquo;, available in the &lsquo;<samp>contrib/scripts/</samp>&rsquo;
directory of the Org Git distribution, or install the xprintidle
package and set it to the variable <code>org-clock-x11idle-program-name</code> if
you are running Debian, to get the same general treatment of idleness.
On other systems, idle time refers to Emacs idle time only.</p>
